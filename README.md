# Anomalyze
Anomalyze is a modular toolkit designed for detecting suspicious behavior in large-scale network logs such as IPDR, CDR, and firewall. Combining unsupervised deep learning, statistical analysis, and geospatial intelligence, the framework helps identify hidden patterns,  and potential security threats in heterogeneous datasets.
